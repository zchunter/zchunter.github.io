		<h1>Hi, I'm Zach Hunter.</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			I'm a Technical Curriculum Developer with a practical obsession for making digital learning better — not just prettier. 
			I build tools, test ideas, and document experiments that help instructional designers move faster, design smarter, 
			and keep learners awake (you're welcome).
		</p>
		<p>
			Right now, I'm exploring ways to streamline course localization using XLIFF files and getting my hands dirty with xAPI 
			for tracking meaningful learner behavior beyond the SCORM matrix. If that sounds like your kind of rabbit hole, you're in good company.
		</p>
		<p>
			This site is where I share tools, insights, and occasional ramblings from the trenches of instructional design. 
			Whether you're here to poach ideas, critique my code, or just see what weirdness I've cooked up next — welcome.
